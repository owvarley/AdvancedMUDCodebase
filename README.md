# AdvancedMUDCodebase (AMC)
A text based space game engine written in C++ based on the MUDCore engine by Gary McNickle. MUDCore provided the basics of socket handling and game mechanics which I extended to create a space theme involving some pretty neat mechanics. This was before I learnt about source control and proper software versioning so there are literally text files everywhere. Check out the VERSION or ChangeLog for more details.
