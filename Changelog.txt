    	:: AMC v0.3 b ::
	      23/12/2005
	      CHANGE LOG
 [A justification for Change]

CL 1.1 :: The old Component system was reviewed by Yaivenov (Billy Puhg, USN) and based upon his comments and
          modern Battleship structure a new system was devised. This system was considered due to its great
		  increase in realism and flexibility for both the players and the administration. It also provided a
		  highly dynamic system which could be expanded or change easily allowing AMC to be modified to fit
		  an Administrators requirements.

CL 1.2 :: With the new Structure (TruShip) the old Shape command was removed and retooled. It reappeared as the
		  Design command which provided a very complex interface for designing ships. For some operations it required
		  7 values to get entered by the player, this type of interface was not ideal and hence it was re-written,
		  see CL 1.3

CL 1.3 :: The original Design command was bulky and very difficult to use properly. A new system was devised by
          implementing an entirely separate command parser for Design commands. This not only allowed each command
		  to be drastically shorted (The maximum number of values entered was 2, a big change from 7!) but also
		  a prompt could be displayed to aid the visualisation during Ship Design.

CL 2.1 :: AMC started using the 2.3 MUDCore codebase as it was a lot neater and contained less game specific 
          implementation compared to the 2.3.1 Release. However, 2.3.1 included a very neat Attribute class,
		  this was ported in to handle attributes in AMC. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

CL 2.2 :: The idea behind adding STAFF to the Player types was to allow a three tier structure to STAFF.
          STAFF, ASSITANT and ADMINISTRATOR. A large deal of research has been placed into Communication
		  within Companies, the best systems were always the most simplistic ones which allowed for a clear
		  chain of communication. Having three tiers the chain is obvious, a STAFF member passes information 
		  to an ASSISTANT who in turn can pass it on to an ADMINISTRATOR. The area of staff structure and
		  further justification can be found in the Design Documentation for AMC. See Staff Structure.doc

CL 2.3 :: The old system for CShape involved storing the exact same data as a HullCube, this was obviously
          redundant and hence was changed. Now CShape provides an easy way to access a summary of information
		  relating to the Shape of the object such as Height, Length, Width, Size, etc.

CL 2.4 :: The DescribeTo function shows a player a room within an area. This area has to have been added to the
		  GameWorld object. Our Template areas are not added to the GameWorld object and hence cannot be viewed
		  without modifying DescribeTo, the justification for not adding Template Areas to the GameWorld object 
		  is that for encapsulation. The only way to access and edit the area is through the use of the
		  Design interpreter. This was changed back to its original form as all area commands require the area
		  to be loaded into the GameWorld.
